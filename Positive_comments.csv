""keep <,up the great work. You are truly an asset to the community. Thanks, for all you do! I like your truthful coverage. BTC's price has been fluctuating lately, buying the capitulation isn't a tough call, but it is a very tough call to figure out what to do aside holding. The good thing about the space is that you can buy the dips and put them into active trades, while confidently waiting for a pump in price because it is inevitable. Most people do not understand how the space works. Your advantage is understanding, Charts won't guarantee what an asset is going to do. Prices will go up or down.Nevertheless, the market has been so profitable despite price ups and down. I've always played safe implementing trades with insights and signals from a renowned trader, Donald Nathan Scott. I made 10.5 BTC from the recent crash and despite the ups and down in the market I’m still bagging more money.""

""Credit score is not something used in all countries though. In France, they determine if you are eligible to get a loan (e.g., to buy a house) based on the ratio between your salary, your expenses and your savings. Basically, if every month you 'burn' all your money, you're perceived as riskier than someone earning less but consistently making deposits to a saving account. I feel in the US people tend to buy things they don't need with money they don't have... The only times I feel one should need a credit is when buying 'big' things (house, car, etc.). Not for a TV.

1:48:00 this explanation of pure functions had me confused for a good part of the day. I looked at other resources and finally understood that pure functions are different from the other two types of function because it does not interact with the block chain (does not store nor retrieve). It is purely a function like in other programming languages hence the name.

I got confused when you passed an address into SimpleStorage, in other languages, one can only pass in an argument into a class if it has a constructor. I was wondering why this behaviour is different in Solidity.
I came up with a solution and it works for me, kindly check it out and let me know, if the solution is optimal.

// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT

pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import """"./SimpleStorage1.sol"""";

contract StorageFactory {
    SimpleStorage[] public simpleStorageArr;

    function createSimpleStorage() public {
        SimpleStorage simpleStorage = new SimpleStorage();
        simpleStorageArr.push(simpleStorage);
    }

    function setSimpleStorageFavNumber(uint256 _simpleStorageArrIndex, uint256 _number) public {
        simpleStorageArr[_simpleStorageArrIndex].setFavoriteNumber(_number);
    }

    function getSimpleStorageFavNumber(uint256 _simpleStorageArrIndex) public view returns(uint256) {
        return simpleStorageArr[_simpleStorageArrIndex].getFavoriteNumber();
    }

This code fetches the favourite number from the simpleStorageArr variable. Is this solution ideal?

Really appreciate the work you put into this video, it's great.
I will like to notify a mistake: 1:36:40 ->

3. afterwards saying that the number assigned to this variable can be up to 256.

There are 2 possible ways to correct this:
- Correcting 2: unsigned integer of 8 bits
- Correcting 3: it can store an unsigned integer to up to (2 to power 256 - 1 -> that's the maximum unsigned that can be saved on 256 bits)""

""Content creating is the hardest passive income to get into in general. Basically, you have to have the network of an influencer and that takes years (8 in your case). This is great info for aspiring content creators, I would say there are much better ways to make complete passive  income through high apy, diverse assets and etc. These are definitely real ways to make passive income and I appreciate your transparency at the beginning of how hard it is to do it. My advice is take a something you're already good at and build on it more or find a capital to start investing with *VIRTUALCRYPTOMINES🟡COM* . If you play an instrument make sound bits, if you write release a book, have an eye for clothes? Thrift and up sale in your own store.

""thanks for this great video, i learnt a ton! i am new to blockchain development, and new to solidity, i have a very trivial detail question, in the get_contract function, if it is not in local blockchain, it will grab the active network(say, rinkeby) address and build contract via contract = Contract.from_abi(contract_type._name, contract_address, contract_type.abi) i am a little confused here,  this rinkeby has a real Aggregator contract deployed, but contract_type.abi is the Mock Aggregator abi, which is different from real Aggregator abi, does this mean when we create a contract we don't need to follow it's ABI? sorry maybe this is a very newbie question...""

Let's not panic and sell when when everything goes down and do not buy in euphoria when everything goes up. I advise everyone to forget predictions and start making profits now because future valuations are all speculations and guesses. The trade market is unstable and you can't easily tell if it's going bullish or bearish.
While Myself and my colleagues are trading without fear of  incurring loses, others are being patient for the price of skyrocket.  It all depends on the pattern you follow.

Guys struggling with math conversion. May be its just me but i don't understand these conversions like 50 USD to ETH. I multiply 10**18 then 10**10 and then something.

2 - Social YEET/Migration(deploy new contract with upgrades and require all users to migrate over to it)
3 - Proxies(2 issues namely storage and function selector clashes) - subdivided into *Transparent Proxy Pattern* and *Universal Upgradeable Proxies Pattern(UUPS)*

Someone will say: ''Bro this is used to store info'' Store info for what reason? what will this thing be used for? why someone add this into their code? will this for example provide [liquidity,tax,fees etc? I at least do not understand why a Storage function is needed or what it can offer.]

""I'm still a long way to complete all 16+ hours of the video. But I have this observation. At 18:30: If your computer and backup computers go down, in regular world, your data is gone. At 19:20: All you need to access your data is a private key, essentially a password. So if you store/save your private key/password in your computer/backup computers and they all go down (no human will be able to memorize the private key), then although your data is sill somewhere, but it's no good because you can't access it anyway. So if the solution is to save the private key in some cloud-based password manager company, then the control is just shifted from a bank to a cloud password company.""

So far my trading experience has been awesome for years with the teachings of career trader Isaac Steward who has been my portfolio strategist.

""1:36:45 you say that """"uint256"""" is an integer of size 256 bit and in the next sentence, you say the value of the variable can be up to 256... I'm sure you only misspoke, but are aware that it's actually 2^256 (which is an incredibly high number, don't know if anyone would ever need a variable that huge, but that's another issue).
Great course so far! Thanks so much for your time and effort, it really means a lot 🙏🏻""

🚀🚀 I will always let  anyone know to forget predictions and start making good profit now because future valuations are all speculations and guesses.The market is very unstable and you can't tell if it's going bearish or bullish.While myself and others are tradn without fear of making a loss others are being patient for the price to skyrocket. It all depends on the pattern you follow.I was able to make 10bTC in just August from implementing tradess with tips and info from Terry Wang
